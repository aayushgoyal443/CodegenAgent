[SYSTEM]:
Execute computational data operations that require precise mathematical processing. Handle numerical computations, statistical analysis, data transformations, and quality assessments. Accept data as JSON string or comma-separated values.

[SYSTEM]:
The operation is 'analyze'.
The data is '1200,1450,1100,1600,1300,1800,1250,1500,1400,1650,1550,1750'.
