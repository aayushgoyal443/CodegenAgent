Summary:

Use React (with Next.js optionally) for frontend.

Use Node.js + Express (JS) or Python + Django/Flask for backend.

Use MongoDB (NoSQL) or MySQL/PostgreSQL (SQL) for databases.

These stacks are the most LLM-friendly, best for generated code, and ensure smoother development.


Add Error Handling and Correction
Run Linter or Tests: Check generated code for errors automatically, preferably with feedback to LLM for fixes.

Provide Troubleshooting: Show errors and suggest how to fix or retry code generation.
